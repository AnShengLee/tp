* Evidence of technical accomplishments 
  * Graphing is a component that is quite tricky as it involves 2d arrays, plotting, incorporating different methods to generate each part of the graph. Scaling of graph is another major component that is quite difficult to accomplish (Required team's help a lot to resolve this)
